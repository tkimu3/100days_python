#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

tip_percent = int(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? "))

# When converting to the particular format, which is the two decimal places,
# Not all numbers can be represented exactry by using round function since the computers
# stores floating point numbers as an integer and then divid it by a power of two.
# (ex) 13.95 will be represented in a similar fashion to 125650429603636838/(2**53).
